<h1>How to open a relay?</h1>
<br>
<i>You need <b>this</b> for it to work:</i>
<ul>
	<li>1. Windows Server, atleast 1GB RAM for correct work.</li>
    <li>2. Static IP, you can use NOIP or another dynamic DNS.</li>
    <li>3. Google DNS</li>
    <li>4. mouseTor Certificate (Instruction on how to get one will be later on this page)</li>
    </ul>
<br>
<h2>Part 1: Windows Server.</h2>
<p>For correct work you need to have a Windows Server OS</p>
<p>If you have this, part 1 is complete.</p>
<h2>Part 2: Static IP, Dynamic DNS.</h2>
<p>If you have any static IPs (non local, but in local network it will work.)</p>
<p>or you have connected Dynamic DNS: After connecting DDNS/Static IP you will need to configure Virtual Servers.</p>
<p>You need to open Port 80 for your server or Port 443 for SSL</p>
<p>At Windows Server you need to configure the Firewall to accept connections to Port 80.</p>
<p>After this, you can start your own mouseTor Website relay. You need to start NGINX/APACHE for this.</p>
<h2>Part 3: Google DNS</h2>
<p>Google DNS Servers are required for a server if you want to have high speed connections and fast MX/NS Records update.</p>
<h2>4. mouseTor Certificate</h2>
<p>If you have started a relay and everything is okay, you need configure some files.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Create a file <b>certificate.ttp</b> (For your certificate at the server)</li>
    <li>Create a file <b>config.dns</b> (For relay to correctly work.)</li>
</ul>
<br>

<p>Write to config.dns your first record</p>
<font color="blue">
	<p>test.monion <b>[SERVER IP]</b></p>
</font>
and if you have more files, then add index.html or another file.
<font color="blue">
	<p>test.monion/filename <b>[SERVER IP]</b>/filename</p>
</font>
<p>For the certificate you need to have a base64 record, create it at <a href="https://www.base64encode.net/">base64encode.net</a></p>
<p>After creating the file you need tell about the created certificate to üêÄMouseüêÄ#2870 on Discord and he will add your certificate if the certificate looks valid.</p>
<br>
<h3>How to create a correct certificate?</h3>
<p>You need to encode text to base64, text needs to look like this AU29AMFGI99A99209AJFMG89AM29</p>
For example:
<font color="green">
AU29AMFGI99A99209AJFMG89AM29 -> QVUyOUFNRkdJOTlBOTkyMDlBSkZNRzg5QU0yOQ== (VALID!)
</font>
<br>
<p>After Mouse has added your certificate to the valid list at official certificate center, you can add the record to your relay. Write the valid record to certificate.ttp</p>
<p>In config.dns you can add any count of records, 1 million or 10 millions, no limits, but if you have an empty config.dns file, all sites will be unavailable from mouseTor Client.</p>
